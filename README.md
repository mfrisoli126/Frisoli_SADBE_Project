# Frisoli_SADBE_Project

Hi all,

This github repository is dedicated to sharing R scripts that I created to analyze data collected from human contact dermatitis patients.  

Certain data files such as RNA differential expression analysis files are also shared here. All data is de-identified, and no raw sequencing data is shared here.


I will try to do my best to respond to any concerns or issues that are requested.


Best,

Mike
